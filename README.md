# Sorting Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* Describe how a Bubble Sort is performed and it's time complexity
* Impliment a sorting algorithm in ruby
* Offer a solution to optomize the algorithm

## To do

* Run the `rspec` in the root directory of this directory.

* Use our pseudo code in class to try to get the tests to pass

## Hint
* Check the [pseudo code listed on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). Make sure you understand how it works.

## Bonus

* Check out the "In-place version" of Quicksort listed on wikipedia. Why do you think that version is faster? Try rewriting another quick_sort algorithm using the in-place version of quicksort. Benchmark it and see if there is a difference.
